# Resume Builder

This project houses the most up-to-date version of my resume. It is currently built using Svelte. I am creating my resume using a frontend framework because it feels much more maintainable in this format. The componentization provides consistency between sections so that I don't have to fumble with formatting in Word (or Figma as used to be the case).

## Installation/Development

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Downloading the resume

There are a couple options to download the resume. There is an automated means that saves the content to an image and an image to a PDF. The downside with this approach is that you lose copy/paste functionality on the text in the PDF document. My "solution" requires a bit of manual attention, but creates a much frendlier document in the end.
